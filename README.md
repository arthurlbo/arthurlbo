Always looking to improve myself day by day, giving my best in every project and impact people's lives.

More than code, I believe every detail matters, like the structure of your project, all the decisions you make and how you're going to manage schedules, demands, contingencies, teamwork, all the things behind it, but that's the part more important.

I'm a Frontend Developer working for being a full cycle, studying software engineering at Universidade Positivo and taking courses on Udemy. I'm proud with that, but a far cry from what I set out to achieve, i have several goals that i know its just time to build it. I work very hard to do my best and learn from all the experiences I have.
