Always looking to improve myself day by day, giving my best in every project and impact people's lives.

I work using technologies like <strong>React and TypeScript</strong>, there is nothing more satisfying than a good page or web app, with a clean code and minimalist design.

At the moment I'm studying software engineering and doing my best to qualify myself more and more. I make a lot of effort to maintain my routine and be a disciplined person, giving my best in everything I do. For me there is no other alternative to conquer and reach my goals.
